Scripts
=======

A collection of shell scripts that I have written to cater to my laziness -- and, hopefully, yours!

| Name | Description |
| ----: | :-----------: |
|  gpush.sh | Short script to speed up pushes. Accepts one parameter for commit message. |
|  playing.sh | Displays current iTunes track, artist, and album title in the command line. |
|  mcl.sh | _mv, cp,_ and _ls_  commands all in one. I told you that I was lazy.|
|.bash_profile | Loads of bash aliases that I find helpful. Many sources.  |
|.vimrc | VIM config file. Not very comprehensive |

Look at that parabora! Completely unintentional. ^^^
